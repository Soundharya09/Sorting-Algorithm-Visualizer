# 📊 Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
## Project Overview 
An interactive web-based application that visually demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work using real-time animations. 
The project also dynamically compares execution times using a graphical representation.

## Features
- Real-time animated sorting visualization
- Execution time comparison graph (Chart.js)
- Generate random arrays
- Clean and responsive UI
- Adjustable animation delay (in code)
- Educational tool for understanding sorting algorithms

## Implemented Sorting Algorithms
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
- Counting Sort

## Tech Stack
- HTML – Structure
- CSS – Styling & Layout
- JavaScript – Sorting logic & animations
- Chart.js – Execution time visualization

## Project Structure

└── script.js      

## How to Run
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open index.html in your browser.
3. Click Generate New Array.
4. Select any sorting algorithm.
5. Observe the animation and execution time comparison.

## How It Works
- Generates a random array of bars.
- Each sorting algorithm updates the array step-by-step.
- DOM manipulation updates bar heights in real time.
- Execution time is calculated using *performance.now()*.
- Results are plotted dynamically using Chart.js.

## Learning Outcomes
This project demonstrates:
- Understanding of fundamental sorting algorithms
- Asynchronous JavaScript using async/await
- DOM manipulation
- Performance measurement in JavaScript
- Data visualization with Chart.js
